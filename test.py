Purpose:
This file contains unit tests for the LearnflowService class.
Testing goals:
    - Verify that entries can be added and retrieved correctly.
    - Confirm that multiple entries are stored (append behavior).
    - Ensure the summary method returns only the latest entry.
    - Confirm clear() resets state.
These tests are written with unittest, which is included in Pythonâ€™s
standard library and commonly used in academic + professional projects.
